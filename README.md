Study Break Snake Game

I tried implementing the snake game in the pop up when the extension is pressed.
but we can definitely change it to having a new window opens up when the extension is pressed cause i did come across issues( listed below)
but my snake game doesnt have the logic to start on a keydown so that might be something we should add haha.

couple things i came across that is not working for me
1. was not able to add the logic to start game on keydown event
2. tried to configure the pop up to match the specification i gave on css file border but doesnt exactly match for some reason...
3. was not able to change background of the popup

the logic that we used for the snake game body is we updated the "tail" of the body node to the position of the head and then the head updates 

i am going to try and add comments to the snake game, if something is confusing feel free to message me!
